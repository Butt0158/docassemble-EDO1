## This question is only asked if the user selects 'multiple' in EDO1_trunk and when the user selects either '2 meters or more' / '3 meters or more' in EDO1_circumference.
# If the user selects 'Yes', application proceeds to EDO1_regulated (if '2 meters or more') or EDO1_significant (if '3 meters or more'). 
# If the user selects 'No', application proceeds to EDO1_exit_screen_3.
